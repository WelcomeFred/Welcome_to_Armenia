The accessible parts between the cliffs are reinforced by towers and walls. The only entrance to the compound is on the northern side protected by walls with round, cone-shaped towers. The walls and towers of the fortress are built from bluish basalt using lime mortar.\nThe 13th c. tower, a three-story construction stands as the main entrance to the fortress and is built into the fortress walls, the main church St. Astvatsatsin  is the most prominent building in the monastery; its portico  with small chapel  where, according to the medieval historians Vardan Areveltsi and Kirakos Gandzaketsi, Prince Ivaneh Zakarian and his son Avag are buried.\nTo the north of the main church are ruins of cells or rooms  attached to the walls and a two-story friary or dining hall, which may also have housed the fortress guards. The two-story building used part of the fortifications for its eastern wall, and a wooden roof. Some of the walls remain, enough to show the large size of this dwelling, which included a community room and dormitory style sleeping chambers. The structure had an entrance to a tunnel, leading to the river gorge, a bath  and underground storage vats.Near the main church are the remains of a 13th century single nave church  partially enclosed by a ditch. It had a semicircular apse protruding from the eastern wall, a common layout beginning in the 5th-6th centuries.\nAkhtala was a major defensive and spiritual center, as the numerous 10th-13th cc fortifications, churches and chapels in the village show. On your way back to the main highway you will see on your right, perched on top of a needle stone, the monastery of St. Yerordutiun (Holy Trinity), two inter-connected churches, a chapel, gallery hall and subterranean rooms.\nOthers are the St. Arakelots (Holy Apostles) or St. Gevorg Church, and a 13th c. spring monument, built on a Vishap stone from the Bronze Age, a pair of hall churches and the Barseghian chapel.

"a2" = "Amberd (Anberd) town-stronghold was erected in the historical Province of Aragatsotn, presently 7 km north-west from Byurakan village of Ashtarak Region of Aragatsotn Province of RA. It is located on the southern slope of Mount Aragats, at the junction point of the Arkashen and Amberd Rivers, on a triangular cape. The exact date of Amberd’s foundation is unknown. Some scholars relate its foundation to the Cyclopean period and the others — to the Uratian and early medieval periods. According to the results of the excavations and historical-archeological researches, the stronghold of Amberd is dated at the X‒XIII cc.\nJudging by historical sources, the construction of Amberd was started by the Kamsarakan Princes, in the VII c. In the X c. the stronghold belonged to the Pahlavuni Princes and was one of the important military-defensive strong points. Thanks to its natural position and defensive structures, it had a reputation of an impregnable stronghold. One of the responsible roles of Ani City’s defensive ring was given to it.\nIn the X‒XIII cc. the town-stronghold involved a series of historical-architectural monuments: stronghold walls, the gates of the Arkashen and Amberdadzor Gorges, a castle, water reservoirs, a bath-house, secret passages, a chapel, dwelling buildings, the Cathoghike Church. At present only the ruins of the town‒stronghold (X‒XIII cc.) and the walls have survived, as well as the remnants of the bath-house (X‒XI cc.) and various constructions, also the Cathoghike Church (Vahramashen) (1026).\nCastle — it was concluded from the results of the researches of the ruins of the basalt-built complex, located in the high-positioned place of the town-stronghold, that it had three storeys, in some places four storeys with inter-storey overhead covers made of logs, and was repeatedly reconstructed and reinforced.\nBath-house — is situated at the castle and at the gate of the Arkashen. It was erected from smoothly hewn stones and had an underground system of heating. This remarkable monument has a rectangular plan with   a cloak-room, located successively along the longitudinal axis, a swimming–hall and a heating system. Traces of frescos are noticeable on the wall of one of the rooms.\nChapel — is located at a distance of about 9 km from the bath-house. It is supposed that the chapel was erected no sooner than the X c.\nThe Cathoghike (Vahramashen) — the Church of Vahramashen, constructed in 1026, under Vahram Pahlavuni’s patronage, is situated at the wall of Arkashen, in the high-positioned central place of the town-stronghold. The church has a domed, cruciform structure. The praying-hall, with the main apse of the eastern side and the vestries of the 4 corners, is included in the rectangular plan. Inwardly it is round, outwardly the 12 faceted drum is adorned with a pair of pilasters and is covered with an umbrella-shaped calotte. The latter is noteworthy and it is the first example of such an overhead cover. Inside of the church, on the wall, is the construction inscription. The exterior architecture of the church is plain and unornamented.";

The highest is the Northern – 4090 m, then North-Eastern – 4080 m, Western – 3916 m and Southern – 3873 m.\nThe climate on Aragats depends on the altitude. From the foot of the mount up to the peak the temperature varies from -3 °C to 10 °C, precipitations – 300-900 mm and more. In summer weather is mild and warm, in winter – cold. The territory is rich with vegetation, many representatives of animal world.\nThere are hundreds of spring waters on the mount. They make up the Qasagh, Amberd, Mantash, Getadzor, Tsaghkahovit rivers.  Here there are tufa, perlite and pumice stone reserves.\nAragats is also associated with tourism. It is one of the most favorite mountains within Armenians. There are lots of songs and works, dedicated to Aragats.";
"a4" = "Ararat is the highest peak in the territory of Armenian Highlands (5165 m). It consists of two cone-shaped peaks:  Sis (3925 m) and Masis (5165m). The mount is situated on the right bank of the river Araks, 32 km of the Republic of Armenia. By the relative altitude Ararat is the highest mount in the world (4300 m). Ararat is in Western Armenia, in the territory of today's Turkey.\nArarat is the biblical holy mount, on which Noah's ark landed after the World Flood. According to the legend only 8 people were saved: Noah, his wife, his sons, and his son's wives. The history of Noah and his family's salvation is described in the Bible (Genesis 7, 8). From Ararat Noah went to South-West. That is why the location is called Nakhichevan «the first shelter».\nIn 1829 Johann Fredrik Parrot was the first to reach the top of Ararat. He was accompanied by Armenian writer Khachatur Abovyan, two villagers: Hovhannes Ayvazyan, Murad Poghosyan and two Russian soldiers: Aleksey Zdorovenko, Matvey Chelpakov. They carried physical and bioclimatic observations on the spot.\nIn June of 1845 academician Abikh, having observed the territory and found the shortest way to the top of the mount, successfully did his mission by his own.\nDue to its beauty, inaccessibility and rich natural resources Ararat was considered magical in the past.  This mount, worthy of honor, found its place in Armenian mythology. According to the old Armenian religion Ararat was the home of brave gods.\nEven today, Ararat continues to delight people from all over the world. Ararat is  our holy mount, which is still one the symbols of Armenia.";
"a5" = "The Byurakan Observatory after V. Hambardzoumyan, located at an elevation of 1500 m above sea level, on the slope of Aragats Mount, is among the largest astronomical centres of the world. The most daring and interesting scientific theses on the birth of galaxies are disseminated to many counties around the globe from here. The studies by the Byurakan School established by Hambardzournyao have left a significant impact on the development of contemporary astrophysics.\nIn 1946, the observatory was founded and managed by the world-famous scientist, the RA National Hero, Academician Victor Hambardzoumyan (1908-1996). He was the founder of the Soviet school of theoretical astrophysics, the President of the Astronomers Union and starting from 1968 President (the only Soviet scientist) of the International Council of Scientific Societies uniting the academies of the sciences of 60 countries and 15 associations. In 1970, in breach of the organization's charter, he was reelected to this post for the second term of office. He was also a member, honorary academician and doctor of the International Astronomical Academy, national, royal societies and universities of many countries. In Armenia the birthday of the scientist - 18 September - has always been celebrated as the Day of Astronomy. The year 2008 was declared as the Year of Victor Hambadzoumyan's by the UNESCO.";

The foundation date of the vestibule built in its western side is unknown, but according to the inscription in here the building was finished in 1266.\nFrom historical sources concerning 9-10cc it is known that Gandzasar's old church served as political and religious meeting place for Artsakh and the surrounding Armenian regions.\nSeveral fully-preserved khachkars from the years 1174, 1182 and 1202 dates are evidence that monastic life and monuments existed here before the building of the new monastery.\nGandzasar in a short period became an important and great hearth of region's cultural life, the seat of Eastern Armenia’s patriarchate and the organizer of the national liberation movement. Beginning in the end of 17th century Gandzasar became one of the region's important centers of national movement of liberation. Gandzasar's Catholicos Yesayi, a fighter devoted to the battle of national liberation, became the head of that movement. In his collaboration Israel Ori he took his first steps towards negotiating with Russia.\nGandzasar's temple consists primarily of the church and the vestibule. St.Hovhannes Mkrtich church has a cruciform interior and rectangle domed exterior (sizes of the hall 12,3x17, 75), the four corners of which occupy the two-story side-chapels.\nThe unknown architect of the temple has created a memorable drum. It is divided into 16 triangular grooves, which are outlined with ornaments. Each triangle has a separate sculpture at its base.\nThe vestibule has been the grave-house of Hasan-Jalalyan's family. Inside the stony ramparts of Gandzasar, in the northern wing of the church there are eight small and two large rooms. Another, a larger two-story building is placed in the eastern part. In the past it served as a school, then a cloister-hotel. In the system of the temple's ramparts the central entry is an important monument, the gate of which is solved with clearly- trimmed stone and architectural original solutions.\nThere are around 200 inscriptions on the walls of the temple.\nThe head of Hovhannes Mkrtich (John the Baptist), brought by Armenian merchants from Venice, is buried under the altar of Gandzasar.";
"a7" = "The Temple of Garni is built in the classical Hellenistic style, and it is the only collonaded building in Armenia. It is said that Garni was constructed by the King Tiridates in the 1st century to worship sun god Mihr. After the conversion to Christianity, the temple became a summer camp for Khosrovadukht, the sister of Tiridates III. The concrete date of its construction is unknown, but the facts show that it was in 77 AD. Garni was designed to orient to the East, to the rising sun. The temple entirely follows the Platonic and Pythagorean theories of the sacred geometry of the day. It is on the edge of a cliff and when you look up from the canyon to the temple, you see how the sun plays upon the stones and makes them glow. The canyon is called “Symphony.” It has obtained this name for its rock formations; a series of perfectly cut granite, slag, basalt and andesite. The Canyon preserves the remains of a 16th-century bridge. Nonetheless, in 1679 the temple was destroyed by a devastating earthquake. A number of people suggested reconstruction plans for the temple, but it was approved only in 1969 by the Soviet government. The idea belonged to architectural historian Alexander Shahinyan. The construction was completed in 1975, and three years later a monument to Shahinyan was erected not far from the temple. Nowadays Garni is one of the main tourist attractions in Armenia and the sanctuary of Armenian neopaganism. The temple is now officially known as the Garni Historical and Cultural Museum-Reserve.";
"a8" = "Geghard is one of the most popular monasteries of medieval Armenia, one of the unique cultural monuments. According to the legend, the monastery was founded during the first years of adoption of Christianity as state religion (the beginning of the 4th century).\nIn the remote past the monastery was called “Ayrivank” (monastery in rock) because of the constructions, dug into the rock; from the  XIII century it was also called Geghard in honor of the spear, kept in the monastery (spear, which Jesus Christ was pierced with on the cross). Before that the cherished spear was kept in st. Echmiadzin. Nevertheless, it was moved from Echmiadzin to Ayrivank because of the unstable domestic and foreign politics. Due to the fact, the monastery started to be called “Geghard” as well. The foundation of the monastery is attributed to Gregory the Enlightener. The main church: st. Mary Virgin or “Katighike”, according to the lithographic inscription found on the Western front exit, was built in 1215 (during the reign of Zakaryans). In the 13th century Duke Prosh bought the church from Zakaryans and started the construction of premises in the rocks (under architect Galdzak’s control). Geghard Monastery was placed on UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2000.\nGeghard Monastery was one of the spiritual and cultural centers of medieval Armenia, where besides religious buildings a school, a library, a typography, lots of cells for local monks were established.\nMkhitar Ayrivanetsi (Mkhitar from Ayrivank) and Simeon Ayrivanetsi (Simeon from Ayrivank) lived and worked right here. They had great contribution in the development of calligraphy art. Geghard is popular with wonderful bass-reliefs and exquisite khachqars. The school had a repository of manuscripts. A part of the manuscripts is kept in Yerevan Matnadaran after M. Mashtots. There were lots of attempts to invade the monastery, but it stood inaccessible, and Geghama mountains were its loyal guardians.";
"a9" = "Founded in the I c.\nDadi or Khuta temple there is a large valley in the place where Gharabagh and Mrav mountain-chains get closer by a sloppy hill (Shahumyan district of Artsakh). On that small, but very beautiful plain's central hill is built one of the remarkable constructions of Armenian architecture - Dadivank or Khutavank.\nEtymology of “Dadi“ and “Khuta“ names are given in two ways in our lithograph- one connected with Armenian custom, the other connected with the district. The first one is connected with one of the 70 students of the Apostle St. Thaddeus, named Dadi or Dado, who preached Christianity in Artsakh and died there.\nThe temple was robbed by Persians, then Arabs, Seljuks, later by Osman Turks and again by Persians.\nThe Ancient church or is situated on the northern slope of the complex. The second church, which is considered one of the ancients too, is adjacent to the first one from south. The western hall had probably served as a chapel.\nThe most important construction period of Dadi temple is the first half of 13c, when begins construction of new buildings. One of the first buildings built during that period is considered Grigor episcope’s vestibule-chapel. The inscription on the right side of the door shows that it was built in 1224 by Grigor episcope. Numerous khachkars were put inside the vestibule’s walls. Grigor episcope vestibule-chapel had been the grave-house of Verin Khachen's prince family throughout centuries. From inside the floor is covered with tombstones, parts of writings on which are already erased.\nArzu-Khatun church-monument stands out like a wonderful monument in Dadi temple complex. Armenian architecture's remarkable and famous this monument is situated in the eastern part of temple's territory, on the brink of the precipice going down to the deep canyon. All the other constructions are placed towards north and south-west from it. Through monk and worldly these buildings in two rows, from the main gate of the rampart to the monument stretches a wide and long passage, which in literature is called «poghota» (avenue). The temple was founded in 1214 by Haterk's great prince Vakhtang Barepasht's wife Arzu-Khatun. The large building inscription of the church (19 long lines) preserved on its southern wall tells about Arzu-Khatun and the construction she started in detail. The inside walls' plaster, destroyed and chapped in some places is covered with badly-preserved frescos.";
"a10" = "Dvin is situated on a hill where a settlement, turned into a fortress in the antique epoch, it was found in the third millennium B.C. In the reign of Khosrov II (330-338) Dvin became the capital, and since the middle of the fifth century till the middle of the 13th century, it was a major trade, handicraft and cultural center of Armenia known in the countries of Asia Minor and Europe.\nExcavations revealed the layout of Dvin which followed the pattern of Armenia's ancient fortified settlements. Double town walls were fortified with large round towers, and the citadel had a moat around it.\nThe rulers palace was situated on the top of a high hill which dominated the town, inside a vast citadel. The rectangular-base building was a two-storey one, with richly decorated presence and residence chambers in the first floor, and service premises, including a bath-house with men’s and women’s sections equipped like that in Garni, in the ground floor. This palace, just as the palaces of feudal lords (nakharars) and the suburban palace of King Khosrov II in the valley of the Azat river, are the pride of Armenian historians who say they are no doubt among the best civil buildings of fifth-century Armenia.\nThe palace of Katholikos - the head of the Armenian clergy - was in the central neighborhood to the west of the citadel, among the monumental stone structures of the city which formed one of the prominent architectural ensembles of Armenia of those times.\nThe ruins of Katholikos’ palace - an imposing edifice built in the 7th century - are very impressive. The front part, built under the influence of the architecture of the Armenian peasant home, had as its nucleus the central hall (11.4 by 26.7 m) with two rows of columns, with rectangular rooms adjacent to its lateral sides. Stone columns with the base shape of the antique type were crowned with eye-catching volute-like capitals. Their face side is adorned with coiled palm leaves, with two others rising from between them, as if from the column shaft.\nThe architecture of Catholicos’ palace in Dvin played a great role in the development of civil architecture in Armenia in early feudal times. A small vaulted church of 553-554 was situated east of the Katholikos’ palace in Dvin. The vestibule and a five-arc gallery on the northern side make it possible to date it back to the fourth-seventh centuries when the temples of this type were built in Armenia.\nSt.Grigory Cathedral was more monumental and Armenia’s biggest one (30.41 by 58.17 m). Built in the third century as a three-nave heathen temple with seven pairs of inner supports, it was rebuilt in the fourth century into a Christian church. In the middle of the seventh century the cathedral was rebuilt into a cross-winged domed temple with apses protruding on the lateral facades.\nThe altar apse was decorated with a mosaic of vari-colored cubes of smalt and tufa representing the Holy Virgin (the 7th century). That was the most ancient mosaic depiction of the Holy Virgin on the territory of Armenia.";
"a11" = "VI mil. B.C.\nOne of the most ancient megalithic constructions of the world is Zorats Karer (Syunik district) not reaching up to Sisian. From the line on a burnt plain row of huge red-brown monoliths are visible. The two-meter pointed blocks last precisely from the south to the north, fencing large territory, in the center they form a correct circle.\nIt is proved, that Zorats Karer is an observatory built in VI mil. B.C. Scientists have found similar constructions in many areas of Europe. The most known of them is the Stonehenge (II mil. B.C.).";
"a12" = "Zvartnots, a complex of buildings near Vagharshapat, has exceptional architectural value. It consisted of Zvartnots temple and the palace of Catholicos. This majestic cathedral was built in 641-661 years by order of the Catholicos Nerses III the Builder, who due to construction activities was called “Builder“. Zvartnots was erected at the place where king Trdat III walked toward Gregory the Illuminator, arriving to Vagharshapat, and it is assumed that Catholicos Nerses III built the temple as a dedication to this meeting. So, the temple is also called St. Gregory, however, it's better known as Zvartnots, since it was also devoted to heavenly angels. “Zvartun“ meant “angel“ in ancient times and, therefore, Zvartnots is Temple of Celestial Angels. According to the medieval Armenian historian Movses Kaghankatvatsi, the cathedral was consecrated in 653. Following the Arab occupation of Dvin and the intensifying wars between the Byzantine and Arab armies on the eastern borders, Nerses transferred the patriarchal palace of the Catholicos from Dvin to Zvartnots.\nAt the end of X century Zvartnots was destroyed probably by an earthquake, but historical sources are silent as to the cause of its collapse. Zvartnots remained buried until its remains were uncovered at the start of the 20th century under the direction of vardapet (Archimandrite) Khachik Dadyan . The site was excavated between 1901-1907 with participation of architect Toros Toramanyan, who restore the temple design and till now most scholars accept this reconstruction. It became known that this central-dome temple consisted of three reducing in diameter polyhedrons crowned with a cone-shaped cupola. Zvartnots was built from light gray to black colored tufa stones and had 5 entrances, and the height of the temple was almost 45 meters, while the diameter of the lower polyhedron was equal to 35.75 meters.\nArchitectural style and beauty of Zvartnots were so significant, that during the final decade of X century, king Gagik I Bagratuni ordered architect Trdat to build a close imitation of the temple in Ani, Gagikashen Church (St. Gregory).";
"a13" = "The Holy See of Echmiadzin is the main religious construction of Armenian Apostolic Church, one of the unique architectural monuments of early Christian period; its architectural solutions became the basis for building of many Armenian churches.\nAccording to the legend, Gregory the Enlightener, who was preaching Christianity in Armenia, had a dream of Jesus Christ coming down from heaven with a hammer in his hand and hitting on the place, where a pagan temple was located. Gregory the Enlightener told his dream to king Trdat (Tiridate), and he ordered to build a temple on that spot and call it Echmiadzin (Only begotten came down).\nThe temple was built in the beginning of the IV century after adoption of Christianity as state religion in Armenia. The building is situated on the place of a pagan temple, the foundation of which is under the main altar.\nThere is a museum in the building of Holy See, where different works of Armenian spiritual art, manuscripts and other artworks are kept. Here there are also collections of coins, carpets, paintings and other valuable materials.  One of the treasures of the museum is Geghard (which Jesus Christ was pierced with) and a remnant of Noah’s Ark.\nThe temple was rebuilt in 7th century by Komitas and Nerses G Catholicoses; in 17th century the belfry was constructed and in the 18th – the The Treasury Museum of Echmiadzin.";

The name of the region derives from Tavush country of historic Great Hayk. Today’s territory partially corresponds to the previous one. The region is rich in rivers. The largest is Aghstev; one of its significant tributaries - Kachaghbyur, leads to the wonderful corners of Ijevan, to Lastiver. Cave, desert, swift river, small and huge waterfalls, forest and wonderful nature. Tourists from abroad, as well as locals, choose a tour to Lastiver, come to see this awesome cave-desert. The road itself is very interesting and attractive, especially for extreme lovers.\nDuring Mongol invasions in XIII-XIV cc locals found their shelter exactly in this cave. The cave is located on almost flat slope of the canyon. In order to reach the cave people had to construct a ladder, made of superposed logs. The ladder reminded a raft. From then on the location has been called “Lastiver”, which is translated as “up the raft”.\nSomeone left a bas-relief on the wall of the cave. It is easy to notice that he wanted to illustrate a wedding. The author was creating this bas-relief during his seclusion in this cave. That is why the cave is also called “Anapat”, which is translated as “desert”.\nThere is wonderful waterfall, noising in the bottom of the canyon. It is the inseparable part of local nature.";

A widow fed him, every day secretly throwing a loaf of bread into the pit. After st.Gregory saved the kind from an incurable disease, Trdat the third let him free. As soon as st. Gregory got freedom, with the king’s support, he declared Christianity as official religion in Armenia.\nIn 642 catholicos Nerses G Tayetsi founded st.

The steep stairs (now steel) on the right side of the main altar lead to the cellar, where the pit of 4,4m diameter and 6m height is located; it has fluted domed cover. During cleaning the thick secular layer of soil a crypt with a priest’s body was found under the pit (probably it is Nerses Tayetsi’s crypt), which was, though, untouched and covered with soil again.\nFrom the 13th century, being a sanctuary, the monastery became alarmenian cultural and educational center as well. In 1255 Vardan Areveltsi founded a high school here, which prominent disciples are Esai Nshetsi, Hovhannes Erznkatsi, Gevorg Skevratsi, Nerses Mshetsi and others.\nIn the 16th century constructions of the monastery were damaged because of the hard political and economic situations. In 1666-1669 David Virapetsi built the protective walls and restored all the constructions of the monastery.\nIn 1703 full restoration of the main st. Astvatsatsin (Holy Virgin) church was completed. In the end of the 19th century the belfry on four decorated columns was added to the Western front of the church.\nIn the Western part of the monastery “Oteats Khach” sanctuary is situated, where, according to the legend, apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew met.\nEvery year in June Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates one of the main holidays “St. Gregory’s deliverance from the pit day” and “St. Gregory’s commitment to the pit day” in March. Celebration of Khor Virap takes place on the Sunday following the Eater Sunday. One-day sightseeing tour “Southern Armenia“ offers you to get acquainted with our history and culture visiting Khor Virap, Noravank, Areni and Jermuk.";
"a16" = "Tsitsernakaberd («Fortress of Swallows») is located on the left bank of the Hrazdan River, in the Eastern part of the city. According to the legend, a temple, dedicated to goddess of love and beauty was located here;   herald swallows on the very top of the temple sent massages to her beloved Vahagn: god of strength and war.\nThe end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th were fatal to Armenian nation. Ottoman Turkey organized and accomplished massive massacre of Armenians on the state level. Turkey reached its final goal in 1915-16. During the massacre, starting from the 12th of April, 1915 we lost 1,5 Armenians...\nDuring Soviet rule it became possible to speak out about this only in the 50-ies. In 1965, on the 50th anniversary of Armenian Genocide, by the project of architects Tarkhanyan and Kalashyanb, a memorial, dedicated to the victims of Genocide, was constructed on Tsitsernakaberd hill.\nThe monument consists of 2 parts. 44 meters high stele means the revival of Armenian nation. According the other version, it symbolizes Western and Eastern parts of Armenia, and even Sis and Masis (two peaks of Ararat). 12 circumferentially arranged stone slabs represent 12 Armenian settlements of Western Armenia, which are in the territory of nowadays Turkey.  According to the other version, they symbolize the main 12 provinces, where the massacre took place. The fire of eternity is located in the centre of the structure.\n100 meters long wall with the most prominent cities and villages (which faced the Genocide) carved on it is situated along the park of the complex.  In 1995 an underground Museum of Genocide was opened in the territory of the complex; it houses information and evidences of foreigners on the fact of the events of 1915. There is a park near the museum, where foreign delegations plant trees in honor of the victims of the Genocide.\nOn the 24th of April, 1965 the beginning of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide was launched. Exactly on that day Soviet Armenia commemorated the victims of the Genocide for the first time.";
"a17" = "XI-XIII cc.\nThe monastery complex of Kecharis is situated in Tzakhkadzor (Gorge of Flowers). A healthy climate and picturesque scenery - forested mountain slopes and blossoming valleys - provided favorable conditions for building there a settlement in which remnants of ancient structures have survived. In the 11th century the settlement was a possession of the Princes Pakhlavuni who founded a monastery there, the construction of which continued till the middle of the 13th century. In the 12th-13th centuries Kecharis was a major religious center of Armenia which had a higher school.\nThe main group of the complex consists of three churches, two chapels and a vestibule, to the west of which, quite a distance away, there was another church with its own vestibule at the side of a road leading to the forest.\nThe main temple, the church of St.Grigory, is the monastery’s first structure erected by Grigor Magistros Pakhlavuni in 1003. Being of a domed hall type, it is one of the typical church structures of the period of developed feudalism in Armenia.\nThe church of Surb Nshan, situated south of the church of Grigory, is a small cross-winged domed structure erected, judging by the type of the building and by architectural details, in the 11th century, probably soon after the former temple.";
"a18" = "X-XIII cc.\nIn the upper reaches of the Aghstev River, there is Haghartzin monastery ensemble of the Tavush district. It is situated in dense oak wood, in the gorge of small but turbulent mountain river. The local terrain and scenery determined the compositional peculiari­ties of this ensemble.\nThe church of St.Astvatzatzin (1281) de­serves special mention. This is the biggest building of all, the artistic dominant of the ensemble. The tall sixteen-faceted dome, dominating all the other structures, is decorated with a graceful arcature. This adds to the optical height of the dome and creates the impression that its drum is weightless.\nThe interesting sculptural group of the church's eastern facade shows two men in monks' attires who point with their hands at a model of a church and a picture of a dove with half-spread wings placed between them. The figures are shown wearing different dresses - the one standing right is dressed richer than the one standing left. The faces, with their long whiskers, luxuriant combed beards and large almond-shaped eyes, are also executed in different manners. These are probably the founders of the church, the Father Supe­rior and his assistant.";
"a19" = "The Haghpat monastery is situated in the north of Armenia, in the same named village (Lori district). Standing on a high plateau, amidst low structures, they rise sharp against the background of steep forest-grown slopes of Bazum ridge.\nThe exact date of the foundation of Haghpat is unknown. Documentary evidence and monuments of material culture suggest that these structure date back to the middle of the 10th century. The formation of Tashir-Dzoraget kingdom of the Kyurikids in 979 and the great attention paid to Haghpat by various rulers of Armenia and their vassals favored the construction of many religious and civil structures there. In this monastery humanitarian sciences and medicine were studied, scientific treatises written and paintings, most miniatures created.\nThe main monastery buildings are grouped around chief temple. Religious structures are of the cross-winged dome type and have side-chapels in four corners, or of the cupola hall type. The structure of the fist type is St.Grigory church (1005), which lost its dome during the reconstruction in 1211.\nThe most important of the cupola-hall type buildings is St.Nshan church, founded by Khosrovanuish in 976 and completed in 991. The decoration, particularly ornamental carving, is very modest. A sculptural group of Smbat and Kyurike kings with a model of the temple in hands, which brings it closer to a three-dimensional sculpture fitted into a wall niche. The interior St.Nshan was decorated with frescoes which are almost totally lost by now. The altar apse was decorated with frescoes twice, the last time in the second half of the 13th century. Probably the whole of the interior was covered with frescoes.\nVestibules were intended for morning and evening services. Parishioners for whom there was no room left in the temple stood there. Such vestibules include the so-called Hamazasp building, erected in 1257. This is the usual type of structure rectangular in the plan - the biggest such structure in Armenia. The squat proportions of the building and its architectural details create the impression of interior and exterior heaviness.\nOriginally, the vestibule of St.Nshan church was a small vaulted gallery-type sepulcher of the Kyurikid kings, built in 1185. Under Father Superior Hovhannes of Khachen it was extended westwards in 1209. The artistic form of the interior is extremely expressive, which makes the vestibule very much different from others.\nVestibules and galleries, as well as special structures, served as sepulchers for members of aristocracy. There are several such structures in Haghpat. They differed from each other in their architectural composition, which is evidence of the great creative ingenuity of their architects. The sepulcher of Ukanants family (the early 8th century) is made as three large rectangular memorial chapels standing side by side. These also serve as pedestals for khachkars.\nThe bell-tower of Haghpat (1245) is one of the earliest examples of structures serving this purpose. This is tall three-floor tower. Its first storey is cross-shaped in the plan, and the second one rectangular, with the angles cut off. The artistic composition of Haghpat’s bell-tower found its reflection not only in later bell-towers, but also in various other buildings - mausoleums and even churches.\nThe book depository of Haghpat (11th) is unique building illustrating the high level of development of civil architecture in the 11th-13th century Armenia. Such buildings were erected, as a rule, away from the main churches of the monastery. They were square-shaped in plan and had a niche for keeping manuscripts in. Special attention was paid to the design of the roof which gave the book depositories a distinctive appearance.\nThe refectory of Haghpat stands out among the civil monuments of Armenia. This structure, dating back to the middle of the 13th century is rare in its architectural composition.\nThe 1258 structure over a water spring in Haghpat, which is still in use, is triple-arched, with the middle arch larger than the side ones. There are stone troughs stretching along the back wall of the structure for watering the village cattle, and also a water reservoir used by local residents. The vaulted composition was prompted by the climate of the country. The cool and damp air inside is a good protection against the scorching midsummer sun.\nHaghpat complex is especially rich in khachkars, which were intended not only as memorials. Most of the khachkar have the traditional shape of a cross which germinated out of a grain, with branches on its sides. In the khachkars of the 10th-11th century the framing of the cross was simpler than that of the 12th-13th century khachkars which developed new stylistic features. Amenaprkich khachkar (1273) stands out for a great number of realistically depicted human figures fitted into the unique composition of the decor.";

The main church - Catoghike, was constricted according to inscriptions of 988-1029 by the ruler Vahram Pahlavuni. It was heavily damaged after the Seljuk’s invasion. In 1225 the grandsons of Vahram Pahlavuni - the archbishop Grigor and his brother Gharib reconstructed Catoghike church.\nThe main church of the Marmashen monastery is of the vaulted hall construction type. The eastern altar is similar to that of the Ani Mair church and is treated with recesses. The Catoghike church is the best example of the Armenian architecture created during the Bagratuni period.\nAttached to the Catoghike church is a second church built approximately at the same time. Only the northern and the eastern walls, formed with shaved red tuf, were still preserved to this day, which goes to prove that the second church with its compositon, architectural details and decorations was similar in many ways to Catoghike church.\nThe third church (11th century) is situated south of the Catoghike church, having been constructed with a centralized vault. There is an entry attached from the west to the Catoghike church characterising that kind of construction with four columns and a centralized vault (still preserved today are the lower parts of the walls and cracked columns’ anchors). This entry served as a mausoleum, and it was where Vahram Pahlavuni was buried, and whose tomb-stone was created in the 19th century.\nDuring 1954-1956 at the south-western entry, the fourth church was excavated from the outside. On the eastern and southern parts of the many monuments there is a cemetery. The monastery had its very own water-supply, which was discovered in the western portion of the entry.

In the 13th-14th centuries the monastery became a residence of Syunik's bishops and, consequently, a major religious and, later, cultural center of Armenia.\nOf great interest are the vestibule of St.Karapet church and the church of St.Astvatzatzin, built by Momik. The church of St.Karapet (the 9th-10th cc.), which has come down to us in ruins, is the most ancient monument of Noravank. To the north of it, there is the main temple, also dedicated to St.Karapet.

Jermuk waters were reliable means of treatment of various illnesses for centuries. According to historical sources, Jermuk was the summer residence of Syunik dukes. There are evidences that people overcame long impassable gorges and narrow trails to have bath in the warm and curing waters of Jermuk. The ruins of the pool, built in the Middle Ages, grounds to assume that mineral waters of Jermuk were used as treatment means from times immemorial.\nJermuk waterfall is really unique; people called this wonder, flowing to the Arpa river gorge from 70 m height, “Mermaid’s hair”.

Its silhouette dominates the adjacent villages and rise sharp against the background of the mountains crowned by Mt.Aragatz.\nThe main temple of the monastery erected by Prince Vache Vachutyan - the church of St.Sion (1215) and belongs to the same type of cross-winged domed structure with two-floor side-chapels in all the corners of the building. Saghmosavank vestibule is accentuated by a double archway the arches of which are not semicircular but pointed.\nThe book repository of Saghmosavank, built in 1255 under Prince Kurd Vachutyan is among Armenia's buildings rare in their purpose and original in their composition. Added to three buildings erected earlier, it is L-shaped in the plan. There is an altar apse on its eastern side and its south-eastern corner has two-floor side-chapels attached to it - a unique phenomenon in the structures of such purpose. The decoration of the book depository, for all its variety of form and detail, probably did not satisfy the architect. Therefore he resorted to color decoration as well. Individual parts of the interior are not only composed of red and black stones, but coated with white, yellow and red paint, which added much to the beauty of the interior. The exterior of the book depository is also quite unusual. The building is as high as the church of St.Sion and its vestibule. The facades are plain and topped with gables.\nThe book repository communicates, through doors, with the vestibule and church of St.Astvatzatzin (Holy Virgin) (1235) to which one can get only through the book depository. This circumstance, as well as the existence of the altar apse, suggests that the building was intended for depositing not only manuscripts, but precious church-plate as well.\nOn the territory of the monastery there are many tombstones, some of them in the shape of richly ornamented khachkars. Of interest is a group of khachkars on pedestal. The latter is an original work in the shape of a four-shaft column on a stepped base with an intricately profiled square capital.";

The structures of the fist type are St.Hakob church (the 9th century), St.Astvatzatzin (Holy Virgin) church, built some time between 928 and 944 and St.Amenaprkich church, completed in 966. Standing out among these churches is St.Amenaprkich built by Khosrovanuish, the wife of Ashot III Bagratuni. This majestic structure has two-tier side-chapels. The severe and majestic eastern facade is crowned in its gable with a monumental sculptural group of Kings Kyurike and Smbat. Chronologically, this is the first high-relief representation of human figures with a model of a church, which gives it great importance in Armenian art. The interiors of St.Astvatzatzin and St.Amenaprkich churches were decorated with frescoes which are almost totally lost by now.\nThe church of St.Harutyun in Sanahin, dating back to the early 13th century, is interesting from the point of view of its composition. Its interior is distinguished by two identical altar apses.\nSt.Grigory chapel, of the same church is a miniature concentric domed structure of the late 10th century. Its plan is circular on the outside and four-petal inside, with horseshoe-shaped apses which impart plasticity to the interior. Vestibules were intended for morning and evening services. Parishioners for whom there was no room left in the temple stood there.\nThe vestibule of St.Amenaprkich church belongs to the four-pillar type. It was built in 1181 by the architect Jhamhayr at the expense of Father Superior Hovhannes and the prince’s family. This is an early example of the widespread buildings of this type based on the composition of the Armenian peasant home. The bases and capitals of the columns are decorated with carvings and relief representations of the heads of the animals.\nThe vestibule of St.Astvatzatzin church, erected by Prince Vache Vachutyan in 1211, is of a different type. It is a three-nave hall covered with vaults and steep two-slope roofs. The grandeur and monumentality of heavy arcades, of the low arches and of the high vaults which seem to draw the walls apart give the interior an integral and expressive character. The western facade with its six high archways is extremely picturesque.\nVestibules and galleries, as well as special structures, served as sepulchers for members of aristocracy. There are several such structures in Sanahin. They differed from each other in their architectural composition, which is evidence of the great creative ingenuity of their architects. The most ancient of them is the sepulcher of Kyurike and David Kyurikids in Sanahin which consisted of two vaulted cells, isolated from each other, one built at the end of the 10 thc, and the other in the middle of the 11thc.\nThe sepulcher of Zakharid princes in Sanahin is more complicated, its eastern part of the end of the 10th century and the beginning of the 11th century is a basement crypt with a vault on wall arches and with chapels rising above it, of which the middle one is rectangular in the plan and the side ones are round and double-storeyed. The latter are of a type stylistically close to St.Grigory chapel from which they differ by their miniature size and by the gracefulness of their architecture. Built in 1189, the western part is simpler - it is a premise rectangular in the plan with an original large ornamented portal. The bell-tower of Sanahin (built between 1211 and 1235) is one of the earliest examples of structures serving this purpose. This is tall three-floor tower with small side-chapels at various levels. The bell-tower is crowned with a light rotunda, which became a characteristic feature of later separate bell-towers of Armenia. The smart western facade is singled out by a large ornamented cross of dark-red stone in a heavily shaped frame. The asymmetrically shaped windows, khachkars and carved spheres of yellow sandstone give the facade a picturesque and appealing look.\nSanahin Academy is an original work of civil architecture built in two stages at the end of the 10th century and at the beginning of the 11th century. This structure, rectangular in the plan, is roofed over numerous closely spaced arches resting on pillars attached to the church walls.\nThe book depository of Sanahin (1063) is unique building illustrating the high level of development of civil architecture in the 11th-13th century Armenia. Such buildings were erected, as a rule, away from the main churches of the monastery. They were square-shaped in plan and had a niche for keeping manuscripts in. Special attention was paid to the design of the roof which gave the book depositories a distinctive appearance. The composition of the interior makes Sanahin’s book depository a unique work of medieval Armenian architecture. Its influence shows in various architectural forms of Armenia’s civil buildings.\nSmall structures over water springs, which are still in use, are of special interest among the monastery buildings. The 1831 structure over a water spring in the yard of Sanahin monastery is a single-arched one: a village structure of this kind in Sanahin, dating back to the end of the 12th and the beginning of the 13th century, is twin-arched. There are stone troughs stretching along the back wall of the structure for watering the village cattle, and also a water reservoir used by local residents. The vaulted composition was prompted by the climate of the country. The cool and damp air inside is a good protection against the scorching midsummer sun.\nSanahin Bridge across the Debet River (1192) stands out among all the bridges found within the confines of the monasteries. This engineering structure of high artistic merits, integrity and perfect harmony is in a class by itself among the numerous bridges of the Transcaucasus. A single-span bridge, it has an original composition prompted by the local terrain: its right side is horizontal, and its left side terraces down to the bank. The parapets of the bridge are decorated with tiny spiked helmets at the edges and with the roughly hewn figures of lying wild cats in the central part.\nSanahin complex is especially rich in khachkars, which were intended not only as memorials. Some of them were installed to mark various events: one was put up on the occasion of building a bridge in 1192, another one, of building an inn in 1205, and others are Tepagir (1011), Tsiranavor (1222), etc. Most of the khachkar have the traditional shape of a cross which germinated out of a grain, with branches on its sides. In the khachkars of the 10th-11th century the framing of the cross was simpler than that of the 12th-13th century khachkars which developed new stylistic features. The lacy patterns and their intricate interweaving on Sanahin’s Grigor Tudevordi khachkar (1184) or Sargis khachkar (1215) are truly amazing for the ultimate skill of their execution.";

In 1918 the Turkish army intruded Ararat valley, occupied the village of Sardarapat and approached Yerevan . On May 22nd, 1918 the crucial battle took place there and brought victory to Armenian people. In the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of that historical battle in May, 1968 this architectural complex was opened. This structure has no prototypes in Armenian architecture. There the architecture and sculpture are harmoniously combined. The complex is built from red tuff. Especially original is the beautiful 35-m belfry-tomb with massive sculptural winged bulls on both sides. The idea of this composition is as follows: the belfry was erected on the place of the graves of the fallen fighters, and the holy bulls symbolize the surviving soldiers of Sardarapat guarding the tomb.\nIt is worth mentioning that Sardarapat is a huge well-kept park where the complex is situated. You can get to the memorial wall with the triumphal arch on the alley with the sculptures of eagles symbolizing the fighters' courage.\nThe memorial wall is decorated with a number of beautiful bas-reliefs and high reliefs.\nBehind the memorial wall the building of the Ethnographic Museum is located.

The building works went on step by step: basically, from the end of the 9th century up to the beginning of the 10th century and in 17th-18th centuries.\nIn 895 the monastery became alarmenian cultural center, where Tatev University functioned with the efforts of Hovhan Vorotnetsi and his disciple Grigor Tatevatsi. Matenadaran (repository of manuscripts) of the monastery (10th century) stood until 1911-12, and the preserved 140 manuscripts were sent to Echmiadzin and then to Yerevan Matenadaran.
